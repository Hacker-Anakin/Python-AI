# AI Python Jupyter Notebook

Welcome to the **AI Python Jupyter Notebook**! This repository is designed to guide you through building an AI system in phases. In Phase 1, we focus on setting up the environment and utilizing essential libraries like `numpy` and `pandas`. Phases 2, 3, and 4 are under construction and will be released in upcoming updates.

## Installation

Before getting started, make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You'll also need to install `numpy` and `pandas` to work through Phase 1.

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hacker-Anakin/Python-AI.git
cd ai-jupyter-notebook
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (optional):
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install required libraries for Phase 1:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas jupyter
```

### 4. Start Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Phase 1: Setup and Data Manipulation

In **Phase 1**, we will:
- Set up your environment.
- Use `numpy` for numerical computations.
- Utilize `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.

### Key Notebooks:
- **`phase1_data_manipulation.ipynb`**: This notebook covers how to work with data using `numpy` and `pandas`. It includes examples for creating arrays, basic mathematical operations, and manipulating datasets with `pandas`.

## Phases 2, 3, and 4

Phases 2, 3, and 4 are currently under development and will include:
- **Phase 2:** Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering (Coming soon)
- **Phase 3:** Model Building and Training (Coming soon)
- **Phase 4:** Model Evaluation and Tuning (Coming soon)

Stay tuned for updates!

## How to Use

1. After installation, open Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. In the Jupyter interface, navigate to `phase1_data_manipulation.ipynb` to start working through Phase 1.
3. Follow the instructions inside the notebook to complete exercises on data manipulation with `numpy` and `pandas`.
